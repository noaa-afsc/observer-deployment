This repo contains code to illustrate some background material pertinant to allocation. 
Three things to consider that could impact allocation design decisions are:

1) sample size - number of units selected - drives variance and probability of
   getting into a box
2) front matter - variance savings that one gets with sample size and sample
   rate (proportion of population sampled)   
3) expansion of trips - how many trips will each sampled trip expand to on
   average
