#I put a csv with the translations from species to species group here:

#If you want birds, you can filter(species_group_id >= 209 and species_group_id <= 224). 
#Alternatively, I think all the bird species_group_names start with "Birds"

#Now, IF there are Eiders in FMA data, I'll need to take catch data for seabirds 
#from observer data to get rates, Mean and variance,
#And I will have to do my best for matching stratum to what is in each design.

#Lets check the FMA data

# Open NORPAC database connection -------
library(sqldf)

channel <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),"AFSC",
                     UID    = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Enter your NORPAC Username: "),
                     PWD    = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Enter your NORPAC Password: "))
# Query Bird data ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#From Andy Kingham FMA, there is a view to query the bird data.
#Lets vet this for the species of interest
birds_in <-
  dbGetQuery(channel,
  "SELECT *
  FROM norpac.atl_birds_in_samples v
  where v.species_code in(850, 851, 864, 865)
  order by v.species_code desc, v.year")

table(birds_in$SPECIES_CODE) #No eiders! Only species 850 & 851.  
#850 851 
#7 178
#This means that there were no eiders seen by FMA either.  
#So we are not missing them (hidden in OBRD in CAS)

#Therefore we will grab them from the valhalla data.

#  Hi Craig,
#Rerunning valhalla was taking a very long time 
#(so long in fact that my computer kept shutting down or throwing an error 
#before it could finish), so instead I took an approach similar to what we do for PSC and 
#pulled the nontarget and ecosystem catch for each report_id since 2012. 
#You should then be able to join that to the multiyear valhalla object that is 
#in 2024_ADP_data.rdata. 
#I note that there's a species_count column in the nontarget and ecosystem catch spreadsheet, 
#so you may need to rename that before joining, 
#since I think there is also a species_count column in valhalla.

#Also, it looks like the query returned so many rows that sql split the output 
#between the first two spreadsheets in the workbook. 
#I checked that all the counts and weights are there, though, and 
#you can bring them in with something like:
