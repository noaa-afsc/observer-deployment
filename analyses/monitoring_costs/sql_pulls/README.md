The `analyses/monitoring_costs/sql_pulls/` folder houses `.rdata` files that are the results of SQL pulls. It should remain empty on the repository, but is necessary as a target for the saving of the pulls or quick-loading from the shared Gdrive, specifically from the `Projects/ADP/Monitoring Costs - CONFIDENTIAL/` Gdrive folder.

Contains:

**kodiak_plant_days.rdata**
